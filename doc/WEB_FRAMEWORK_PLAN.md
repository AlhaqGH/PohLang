## PohLang Syntax Design

### Route Definition
```poh
# Basic route
Add route "/users" with method "GET" to server:
    Write json response with users_list

# Route with path parameters
Add route "/users/:id" with method "GET" to server:
    Set user_id to request["params"]["id"]
    Set user to find_user with user_id
    Write json response with user

# Route groups
Create route group "/api/v1":
    Add route "/users" with method "GET":
        Write json response with users
    
    Add route "/posts" with method "GET":
        Write json response with posts
End group
```

### Middleware
```poh
# Add middleware
Add middleware "cors" to server:
    Set response to request["response"]
    Set header "Access-Control-Allow-Origin" to "*" in response
    Return response

# Authentication middleware
Add middleware "auth" to server:
    Set token to request["headers"]["Authorization"]
    If token is empty
        Write json response with error "Unauthorized" and status 401
        Return
    End
    # Continue to next handler
```

### File Upload
```poh
Add route "/upload" with method "POST" to server:
    Set file to request["files"]["document"]
    Set filename to file["name"]
    Set filepath to "./uploads/" plus filename
    Save file to filepath
    Write json response with Make a dictionary with "success" set to true, "file" set to filename
```

### Sessions
```poh
Add route "/login" with method "POST" to server:
    Set username to request["body"]["username"]
    Set password to request["body"]["password"]
    
    If authenticate with username, password
        Set session["user"] to username
        Write json response with success message
    Otherwise
        Write json response with error "Invalid credentials" and status 401
    End
```

### Static Files
```poh
# Serve static files from directory
Serve static files from "./public" at "/static"

# Or in route
Add route "/assets/*" with method "GET" to server:
    Set file_path to request["params"]["*"]
    Serve file from "./assets/" plus file_path
```

### WebSockets
```poh
Add websocket "/chat" to server:
    On connect:
        Write "User connected"
        Join room "main"
    
    On message:
        Set msg to websocket["message"]
        Broadcast to room "main" with msg
    
    On disconnect:
        Write "User disconnected"
```

### Database
```poh
# Connect to database
Set db to connect to database "sqlite:./app.db"

# Query
Set users to query db with "SELECT * FROM users WHERE age > ?" and params Make a list of 18

# Insert
Insert into db table "users" with Make a dictionary with "name" set to "Ada", "age" set to 36

# Update
Update db table "users" set Make a dictionary with "active" set to true where "id" equals 5
```

```

## Next Steps

1. Enhance existing http.rs with path parameters
2. Create router.rs for advanced routing
3. Create middleware.rs for middleware pipeline
4. Create upload.rs for file handling
5. Create comprehensive examples

Would you like me to start implementing these features now?
