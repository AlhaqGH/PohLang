# Documentation Updates - October 5, 2025

## Summary

Updated all documentation to accurately reflect that PohLang is now a **Rust-only repository** containing just the core runtime. The Python Interpreter and Dart Transpiler have been moved to the PLHub repository.

---

## Files Updated

### 1. **README.md** ✅
**Changes Made**:
- ✅ Removed references to Python Interpreter and Dart Transpiler

- ✅ Added PLHub reference for complete development experience
- ✅ Updated feature list with checkmarks and current status
- ✅ Simplified roadmap overview
- ✅ Updated contributing section with correct paths

**Key Additions**:
```markdown
> **Note**: This repository contains the **core Rust runtime only**. 
> For the complete development environment including CLI tools, package 
> management, and editor integration, see [PLHub](https://github.com/AlhaqGH/PLHub).

## Repository Overview
**PohLang** = The core language runtime (this repository)  
**PLHub** = The complete development environment (separate repository)
```

### 2. **ROADMAP.md** ✅
**Changes Made**:
- ✅ Updated Phase 1 progress to reflect ~90% completion
- ✅ Removed references to "eliminating Dart dependencies" (already done)
- ✅ Updated current status section with accurate dates and completion
- ✅ Removed outdated "Phase 5: Remove Dart" section
- ✅ Consolidated into Phase 5: Ecosystem & Tooling
- ✅ Updated success criteria to reflect Rust-only status
- ✅ Fixed current status percentages and next steps

**Key Changes**:
- Phase 1: ~90% complete ✅ (was ~60%)
- Removed reference to Python test cases
- Updated next steps to reflect actual current priorities

---

### 3. **PohLang_Guide.md** ✅
**Changes Made**:
- ✅ Updated system module import documentation
- ✅ Removed reference to `Interpreter/stdlib/` path
- ✅ Updated "Command-line usage" section
- ✅ Removed Python interpreter instructions
- ✅ Fixed Rust runtime paths (`runtime/` not `runtime-rs/`)
- ✅ Added comprehensive build and run instructions
- ✅ Added PLHub reference for development environment

**Before**:
```markdown
Two ways to run PohLang today:
- Python interpreter (legacy reference): under `Interpreter/`.
- Rust runtime (recommended): under `runtime-rs/`
```

**After**:
```markdown
### Building the Runtime
cargo build --manifest-path runtime/Cargo.toml

### Running Programs
cargo run --manifest-path runtime/Cargo.toml -- --run path/to/script.poh

### Using PLHub
For a complete development environment, use PLHub
```

---

### 4. **runtime/README.md** ✅
**Changes Made**:
- ✅ Fixed all references from `runtime-rs/` to `runtime/`
- ✅ Fixed corrupted C++ text (showed as "")
- ✅ Added program structure documentation
- ✅ Updated CLI options with clearer descriptions
- ✅ Added comprehensive "Current Status" section
- ✅ Added feature checklist with completion status
- ✅ Linked to main ROADMAP.md
- ✅ Added contributing section reference

**New Section Added**:
```markdown
### Program Structure
PohLang programs must be wrapped in `Start Program` ... `End Program` blocks:

Start Program
Write "Hello World"
Set x to 42
Write x
End Program
```

---

## Testing Performed

### Build Test ✅
```pwsh
cargo build --manifest-path runtime/Cargo.toml
# Result: Successful compilation
```

### Runtime Test ✅
```pwsh
cargo run --manifest-path runtime/Cargo.toml -- --run examples/poh/test_hello.poh
# Result: Program executed successfully
# Output:
#   Hello from PohLang!
#   Testing the Rust runtime
#   10 plus 5 equals:
#   15
```

### New Test File Created ✅
- Created `examples/poh/test_hello.poh` with proper `Start Program`/`End Program` structure
- Verified it runs successfully with the Rust runtime

## Repository Structure - Current vs Documented

### Before Documentation Update (Incorrect)
```
PohLang/
├── Interpreter/        ❌ (doesn't exist here)
├── runtime-rs/         ❌ (wrong path)
├── tests_python/       ❌ (doesn't exist)
└── transpiler/         ❌ (doesn't exist here)
```

### After Documentation Update (Correct) ✅
```
PohLang/
├── runtime/            ✅ Rust runtime (only component)
│   ├── src/
│   ├── tests/
│   └── Cargo.toml
├── examples/poh/       ✅ Sample programs
├── spec/               ✅ Language specification
├── doc/                ✅ Documentation
└── ROADMAP.md          ✅ Development roadmap
```

---

## Known Issues Documented

### Example Files
⚠️ **Note**: Most existing example files in `examples/poh/` do NOT have the required `Start Program`/`End Program` wrapper and will fail to run with the current Rust runtime.

**Action Items** (Future):
- [ ] Update all example files to include `Start Program`/`End Program`
- [ ] OR: Make the program wrapper optional in the parser
- [ ] Decision needed on language design philosophy

---

## Cross-References Updated

All documentation now correctly references:
- ✅ PohLang repository for core runtime
- ✅ PLHub repository for development tools
- ✅ Correct directory paths (`runtime/` not `runtime-rs/`)
- ✅ Accurate feature completion status
- ✅ Realistic roadmap timelines

---

## Summary of Architecture Clarification

### PohLang Repository (This Repo)
- **Purpose**: Core language runtime
- **Contains**: Rust parser, VM, compiler (in development)
- **Like**: The Rust language itself

### PLHub Repository (Separate)
- **Purpose**: Development environment and tooling
- **Contains**: Python Interpreter, Dart Transpiler (legacy), CLI tools, package manager
- **Like**: Cargo/rustup for Rust

---

## Verification Checklist

- [x] README.md updated and accurate
- [x] ROADMAP.md reflects current state
- [x] PohLang_Guide.md has correct instructions
- [x] runtime/README.md has correct paths
- [x] Build test passes
- [x] Runtime test passes
- [x] Example program created and tested
- [x] All cross-references verified
- [x] Architecture clearly documented

---

## Next Recommended Actions

1. **Update Example Files**: Add `Start Program`/`End Program` to all `.poh` examples
2. **CI/CD**: Update GitHub Actions workflows if they reference old paths
3. **Wiki/External Docs**: Update any external documentation
4. **Announce**: Consider announcing the repository restructure to contributors
5. **Archive**: Consider archiving or clearly marking the old Python/Dart code in PLHub
