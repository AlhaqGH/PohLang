## ✨ What's New in v0.5.0

### 20 Phrasal Built-in Expressions

#### Mathematical Operations (7)
```pohlang
Write total of [10, 20, 30]           # 60
Write smallest in [5, 2, 8]           # 2
Write largest in [5, 2, 8]            # 8
Write absolute value of -42           # 42
Write round 3.7                       # 4
Write round down 3.9                  # 3
Write round up 3.1                    # 4
```

#### String Operations (3)
```pohlang
Write make uppercase "hello"          # HELLO
Write make lowercase "WORLD"          # world
Write trim spaces from "  text  "     # text
```

#### Collection Operations (10)
```pohlang
Set nums to [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

Write first in nums                   # 1
Write last in nums                    # 5
Write reverse of nums                 # [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
Write count of nums                   # 5

Set text to join nums with ", "       # "1, 2, 3, 4, 5"
Set parts to split "a,b,c" by ","     # ["a", "b", "c"]

Write contains 3 in nums              # True
Set removed to remove 3 from nums     # [1, 2, 4, 5]
Set added to append 6 to nums         # [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
Set inserted to insert 10 at 2 in nums  # [1, 2, 10, 3, 4, 5]
```

#### Friendly Aliases (4)
```pohlang
Write size of nums                    # Alias for "count of"
Set parts to separate text by ","     # Alias for "split by"
Write reverse nums                    # Alias for "reverse of"
Set clean to clean spaces from txt    # Alias for "trim spaces from"
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Installation

1. **Download** `pohlang-v0.5.0-windows-x64.zip` from the Assets section below
2. **Extract** to any folder
3. **Run** `pohlang.exe --version` to verify installation

### Your First Program

Create `hello.poh`:
```pohlang
Start Program

Write "Welcome to PohLang v0.5.0!"

# Collections
Set numbers to [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
Write "Numbers: " plus numbers
Write "Total: " plus total of numbers

# String manipulation
Set message to "   hello world   "
Set clean to trim spaces from message
Set upper to make uppercase clean
Write "Message: " plus upper

# Checking membership
If contains 30 in numbers
    Write "Found 30 in the list!"
End If

End Program
```

Run it:
```powershell
pohlang.exe --run hello.poh
```

- **Test suite**: <2 seconds (50 tests)
- **Parser**: Optimized recursive descent with proper precedence
- **VM**: Efficient tree-walking interpreter
- **Binary size**: ~4MB (release, with optimizations)

### Quality Assurance
```
✅ 6 function tests   - Closures, parameters, calls, error handling
✅ 7 phrasal tests    - All new collection/string operations
✅ 37 smoke tests     - Core features, precedence, edge cases
──────────────────────
   50 tests total    - 100% passing
```

### Architecture
- **Language**: Rust (optimized release build)
- **Build**: opt-level=3, LTO enabled
- **Platform**: Windows x64
- **Dependencies**: anyhow, clap (minimal)

## 🎯 What's Next: Phase 2

Phase 2 development begins with focus on:

### Standard Library Modules
- `collections` - Advanced list/dict operations
- `random` - Random number generation
- `datetime` - Date/time handling
- `math` - Extended mathematical functions
- `file` - File I/O operations

### Module System
```pohlang
Import system "collections" as coll
Import system "random" exposing shuffle, choice

Set numbers to coll::map(data, transform)
Set shuffled to shuffle(numbers)
```

See [ROADMAP.md](doc/ROADMAP.md) for complete Phase 2 plans.

## 📝 Migration from v0.1.0

**Good news**: No breaking changes! All v0.1.0 programs continue to work in v0.5.0.

### New Features Available
- 20 phrasal built-in expressions (additive)
- Improved error messages (better UX)
- Centralized phrase management (no user impact)

### Recommended Updates
Consider using new phrasal expressions for clearer code:

**Before (v0.1.0):**
```pohlang
Set total to sum(numbers)
Set length to len(text)
```

**After (v0.5.0):**
```pohlang
Set total to total of numbers
Set length to count of text
```

Both styles work, but phrasal form is more readable!
