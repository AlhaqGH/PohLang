# Phase 3 Implementation Complete ✅

**Date:** October 9, 2025  
**Version:** PohLang v0.5.2 + Parser Integration  
**Duration:** ~4 hours

---

## Summary

Successfully completed Phase 3 of PohLang development: **Parser Integration for File I/O Operations**

All file I/O functions implemented in Phase 2 are now fully accessible from PohLang syntax through natural phrasal expressions!

---

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Phrasal Expression Constants (`phrases.rs`)
Added 15 new phrasal expression constants for file operations:
- `P_READ_FILE` - "read file at "
- `P_WRITE_FILE` + `P_WRITE_TO_FILE` - "write ... into file at "
- `P_APPEND_FILE` + `P_APPEND_TO_FILE` - "append ... into file at "
- `P_FILE_EXISTS` - "file exists at "
- `P_DELETE_FILE` - "delete file at "
- `P_CREATE_DIR` - "create directory at "
- `P_LIST_DIR` / `P_LIST_DIR_ALT` - "list files in " / "list files in directory at "
- `P_READ_LINES` / `P_READ_LINES_ALT` - "read lines from file at " / "read lines from "
- `P_COPY_FILE` + `P_COPY_TO` - "copy file from ... to "
- `P_MOVE_FILE` - "move file from ... to "

**Note:** Changed from "to file at" to "into file at" to avoid conflict with Set statement parsing.

### 2. AST Expression Types (`ast.rs`)
Added 10 new `Expr` variants:
```rust
ReadFile(Box<Expr>)                       // read file at path
WriteFile(Box<Expr>, Box<Expr>)           // write content into file at path
AppendFile(Box<Expr>, Box<Expr>)          // append content into file at path
FileExists(Box<Expr>)                     // file exists at path
DeleteFile(Box<Expr>)                     // delete file at path
CreateDir(Box<Expr>)                      // create directory at path
ListDir(Box<Expr>)                        // list files in directory at path
ReadLines(Box<Expr>)                      // read lines from file at path
CopyFile(Box<Expr>, Box<Expr>)            // copy file from source to dest
MoveFile(Box<Expr>, Box<Expr>)            // move file from source to dest
```

### 3. Parser Logic (`parser.rs`)
Added parsing rules for all 10 file I/O operations in the `parse_primary` function. The parser now recognizes:
- Simple operations: `read file at "path"`, `file exists at "path"`
- Binary operations: `write "content" into file at "path"`, `copy file from "src" to "dest"`

### 4. VM Execution (`vm.rs`)
Implemented expression evaluation in 4 different VM contexts:
- **`eval()`** - Main evaluation function with full file I/O logic
- **`eval_in_frame()`** - Delegates to `eval()` for file operations
- **`eval_in_scope()`** - Delegates to `eval()` for file operations
- **`eval_in_scope_with_capture()`** - Delegates to `eval()` for file operations
- **`dump_expr()`** - Pretty-printing for debugging

Added `bail` macro import for proper error handling.

### 5. Example Programs
Updated 4 example programs with proper syntax:
- `file_write.poh` - Write "Hello from PohLang File I/O!" to output.txt
- `file_read.poh` - Read content from data.txt and display it
- `file_append.poh` - Write and append lines to log.txt
- `file_exists.poh` - Check if file exists and create it if not

### 6. Integration Tests (`tests/file_io.rs`)
Created comprehensive test suite with **10 integration tests**:
1. ✅ `test_write_and_read_file` - Write and read operations
2. ✅ `test_append_to_file` - Appending content
3. ✅ `test_file_exists` - File existence checking (both true/false cases)
4. ✅ `test_delete_file` - File deletion
5. ✅ `test_create_directory` - Directory creation
6. ✅ `test_list_directory` - Listing directory contents
7. ✅ `test_read_lines` - Reading file as line array
8. ✅ `test_copy_file` - Copying files
9. ✅ `test_move_file` - Moving/renaming files
10. ✅ `test_file_not_found_error` - Error handling for missing files

## PohLang Syntax Examples

### Writing to a File
```pohlang
Start Program
Set result to write "Hello from PohLang!" into file at "output.txt"
Write "File written successfully!"
End Program
```

### Reading from a File
```pohlang
Start Program
Set content to read file at "data.txt"
Write "File contents:"
Write content
End Program
```

### Appending to a File
```pohlang
Start Program
Set r1 to write "Line 1\n" into file at "log.txt"
Set r2 to append "Line 2\n" into file at "log.txt"
Set r3 to append "Line 3\n" into file at "log.txt"
Set content to read file at "log.txt"
Write content
End Program
```

### Checking if File Exists
```pohlang
Start Program
Set fileExists to file exists at "myfile.txt"
If fileExists is equal to True Write "File exists!" Otherwise Write "File not found"
End Program
```

### Copying and Moving Files
```pohlang
Start Program
Set r to copy file from "source.txt" to "backup.txt"
Set r to move file from "temp.txt" to "archive.txt"
End Program
```

### Listing Directory Contents
```pohlang
Start Program
Set files to list files in "my_directory"
Write files
End Program
```

### Reading File as Lines
```pohlang
Start Program
Set lines to read lines from file at "data.txt"
Write lines
End Program
```

## Technical Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Phrase Conflict with Set Statement
**Problem:** The phrase "write ... to file at ..." conflicted with "Set x to ..." parsing, causing "to" to be treated as the set delimiter.

**Solution:** Changed phrase from "to file at" to "into file at", eliminating the ambiguity.

### Challenge 2: If Statement Boolean Evaluation
**Problem:** Block If statements like `If fileExists then` failed to parse because "then" was included in the expression.

**Solution:** Used explicit comparison: `If fileExists is equal to True` or inline If syntax without blocks.

### Challenge 3: Multiple Eval Functions
**Problem:** VM has 4 different expression evaluation contexts (eval, eval_in_frame, eval_in_scope, eval_in_scope_with_capture) requiring file I/O cases in each.

**Solution:** Implemented full logic in main `eval()` and delegated from other contexts using pattern matching on all file I/O variants.

### Challenge 4: Missing bail Macro
**Problem:** Compiler errors for undefined `bail!` macro in error handling.

**Solution:** Added `use anyhow::{anyhow, bail, Result};` import.

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Async File Operations** - Add non-blocking I/O for large files
2. **Stream Processing** - Line-by-line reading for huge files
3. **File Metadata** - Get file size, modification time, permissions
4. **Path Operations** - Join paths, get directory name, file extension
5. **Binary File Support** - Read/write binary data
6. **File Watching** - Monitor files for changes
7. **Compression** - Zip/unzip operations

### Parser Enhancements
1. **Better Error Messages** - More specific hints for file I/O syntax errors
2. **Alternative Syntaxes** - Support multiple ways to express same operation
3. **Shorthand Forms** - Abbreviated versions for common operations

## Documentation

### Syntax Reference

#### Single-Value Operations
```
read file at <path>                    → String
file exists at <path>                  → Boolean
delete file at <path>                  → Null
create directory at <path>             → Null
list files in <path>                   → List of Strings
read lines from file at <path>         → List of Strings
```

#### Two-Value Operations
```
write <content> into file at <path>    → Null
append <content> into file at <path>   → Null
copy file from <source> to <dest>      → Null
move file from <source> to <dest>      → Null
```

### Return Values
- `String` - File content (read_file)
- `Boolean` - True/False (file_exists)
- `List` - Array of strings (list_dir, read_lines)
- `Null` - Success with no return value (write, append, delete, create_dir, copy, move)
- `Error` - Exception with detailed message on failure

## Backwards Compatibility

✅ **100% Backwards Compatible**

- All existing PohLang programs continue to work
- No breaking changes to syntax
- File I/O is additive - doesn't affect existing features
- Parser prioritizes existing rules over new file I/O rules
