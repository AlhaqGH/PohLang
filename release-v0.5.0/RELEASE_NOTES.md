## ✨ What's New in v0.5.0

### 20 Phrasal Built-in Expressions

PohLang now includes comprehensive natural-language expressions for common operations:

#### Mathematical Operations (7)
```pohlang
Write total of [10, 20, 30]           # 60
Write smallest in [5, 2, 8]           # 2
Write largest in [5, 2, 8]            # 8
Write absolute value of -42           # 42
Write round 3.7                       # 4
Write round down 3.9                  # 3
Write round up 3.1                    # 4
```

#### String Operations (3)
```pohlang
Write make uppercase "hello"          # HELLO
Write make lowercase "WORLD"          # world
Write trim spaces from "  text  "     # text
```

#### Collection Operations (10)
```pohlang
Set nums to [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

Write first in nums                   # 1
Write last in nums                    # 5
Write reverse of nums                 # [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
Write count of nums                   # 5

Set text to join nums with ", "       # "1, 2, 3, 4, 5"
Set parts to split "a,b,c" by ","     # ["a", "b", "c"]

Write contains 3 in nums              # True
Set removed to remove 3 from nums     # [1, 2, 4, 5]
Set added to append 6 to nums         # [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
Set inserted to insert 10 at 2 in nums  # [1, 2, 10, 3, 4, 5]
```

#### Friendly Aliases (4)
```pohlang
Write size of nums                    # Alias for "count of"
Set parts to separate text by ","     # Alias for "split by"
Write reverse nums                    # Alias for "reverse of"
Set clean to clean spaces from txt    # Alias for "trim spaces from"
```

### Grammar & Architecture Improvements

#### Unambiguous Grammar
- **Proper operator precedence** hierarchy fully implemented
- Multiplication/Division before Addition/Subtraction
- Comparisons before logical operators
- Left-to-right associativity verified
- Every valid program has exactly **one parse tree**

#### Centralized Phrase Management
- New `runtime/src/parser/phrases.rs` module
- All phrasal constants in one place
- Easy to extend with new expressions
- Eliminates hardcoded string repetition

#### Comprehensive Documentation
- **GRAMMAR_ANALYSIS.md**: Mathematical proof of unambiguity
- **CONTRIBUTING.md**: Developer guide for adding features
- **Updated Vocabulary**: All 20 phrasal expressions documented
- **Updated Guide**: Examples for every feature

### Quality Assurance

#### Test Coverage
```
✅ 6 function tests   - Closures, parameters, calls, error handling
✅ 7 phrasal tests    - All new collection/string operations
✅ 37 smoke tests     - Core features, precedence, edge cases
──────────────────────
   50 tests total    - 100% passing
```

#### CI/CD
- GitHub Actions workflow for automated testing
- Matrix builds across Ubuntu, Windows, macOS
- Rust toolchain setup with cargo caching
- Automated test execution on every push/PR

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Installation

#### From Source (Recommended)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AlhaqGH/PohLang.git
cd PohLang/runtime
cargo build --release
```

The compiled binary will be at:
- **Windows**: `target\release\pohlang.exe`
- **Linux/Mac**: `target/release/pohlang`

### Running Your First Program

Create `hello.poh`:
```pohlang
Start Program

Write "Welcome to PohLang v0.5.0!"

# Collections
Set numbers to [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
Write "Numbers: " plus numbers
Write "Total: " plus total of numbers
Write "Average: " plus (total of numbers) divided by (count of numbers)

# String manipulation
Set message to "   hello world   "
Set clean to trim spaces from message
Set upper to make uppercase clean
Write "Message: " plus upper

# Checking membership
If contains 30 in numbers
    Write "Found 30 in the list!"
End If

# List manipulation
Set extended to append 60 to numbers
Set modified to remove 20 from extended
Write "Modified list: " plus modified

End Program
```

Run it:
```bash
# Using cargo
cargo run --release -- --run hello.poh

# Or directly
./target/release/pohlang --run hello.poh
```

### Dependencies
- **anyhow**: Error handling
- **clap**: Command-line interface
- **assert_cmd**: Testing utilities
- **predicates**: Test assertions
- **tempfile**: Temporary file handling

## 🎯 What's Next: Phase 2

Phase 2 development begins immediately with focus on:

### Standard Library Modules
- `collections` - Advanced list/dict operations
- `random` - Random number generation
- `datetime` - Date/time handling
- `math` - Extended mathematical functions
- `file` - File I/O operations
- `islamic` - Islamic calendar utilities

### Module System
```pohlang
Import system "collections" as coll
Import system "random" exposing shuffle, choice

Set numbers to coll::map(data, transform)
Set shuffled to shuffle(numbers)
```

### Enhanced Features
- Module namespacing (`module::function`)
- Exposing specific symbols from modules
- Module aliases for convenience
- Qualified calls for clarity

See [ROADMAP.md](doc/ROADMAP.md) for complete Phase 2 plans.

- **Testing**: More test cases, edge case discovery
- **Community**: Share PohLang with educators and learners

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for developer guide.

## 📝 Migration from v0.1.0

**Good news**: No breaking changes! All v0.1.0 programs continue to work in v0.5.0.

### New Features Available
- 20 phrasal built-in expressions (additive)
- Improved error messages (better UX)
- Centralized phrase management (no user impact)

### Recommended Updates
Consider using new phrasal expressions for clearer code:

**Before (v0.1.0):**
```pohlang
Set total to sum(numbers)
Set length to len(text)
```

**After (v0.5.0):**
```pohlang
Set total to total of numbers
Set length to count of text
```

Both styles work, but phrasal form is more readable!

## 🐛 Known Issues

None! 🎉

Phase 1 is feature-complete with no known bugs. All tests passing.

Minor notes:
- End-of-line comments not supported (use separate line)
- "Make a list of" syntax has quirks (prefer `[...]` notation)
- These are design decisions, not bugs

## 📊 Comparison: v0.1.0 vs v0.5.0

| Feature | v0.1.0 | v0.5.0 |
|---------|--------|--------|
| **Test Coverage** | Partial | 50 tests (100%) |
| **Phrasal Built-ins** | 0 | 20 |
| **Grammar Analysis** | Informal | Formal proof |
| **Operator Precedence** | Working | Verified |
| **Documentation** | Basic | Comprehensive |
| **CI/CD** | Manual | Automated |
| **Phase Status** | In Progress | Complete ✅ |
