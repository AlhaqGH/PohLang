# Simple Release Workflow Status

## Current Situation

‚úÖ **Main CI Workflows:** PASSING  
- `CI #45` - All checks passing (formatting, clippy, build, tests)
- `runtime-rs CI #43` - Build and test passing

‚ùå **Simple Release Workflow:** FAILED  
- Triggered automatically when tag `v0.6.1` was pushed
- Workflow builds binaries for Linux, Windows, macOS
- Attempts to upload binaries to GitHub Release

## Why It's Failing

The `simple-release.yml` workflow uses `softprops/action-gh-release@v1` which has two modes:

1. **Create new release** if it doesn't exist
2. **Update existing release** if it already exists

The workflow is likely failing for one of these reasons:

### Possible Cause 1: Release Already Exists (Partial)
If a release draft was created, the workflow might be conflicting.

### Possible Cause 2: Permission Issues
The workflow needs `contents: write` permission to create releases.

### Possible Cause 3: Tag Reference Issue
The workflow extracts the tag but might have issues with the reference format.

## Recommended Solution

You have **two options**:

### Option A: Let the Workflow Create the Release (Automated)

1. **Delete the existing tag** (to reset):
   ```powershell
   cd C:\Users\habib\POHLANG\PohLang
   git tag -d v0.6.1
   git push origin :refs/tags/v0.6.1
   ```

2. **Recreate and push the tag** (triggers workflow again):
   ```powershell
   git tag -a v0.6.1 -m "Release v0.6.1 - Enhanced VM Error Messages & Bug Fixes"
   git push origin v0.6.1
   ```

3. **Wait for workflow** to complete (5-10 minutes)
   - Workflow will build binaries for all platforms
   - Automatically create the release
   - Upload all binary packages

4. **Edit the release** on GitHub afterward:
   - Add detailed release notes from `RELEASE_PUBLICATION_GUIDE_v0.6.1.md`
   - Upload additional artifacts (VSIX files if desired)

### Option B: Create Release Manually (Recommended)

This gives you more control over release notes and attached files.

1. **Accept that the workflow failed** (it's okay!)

2. **Manually create the release on GitHub:**
   - Go to: https://github.com/AlhaqGH/PohLang/releases/new?tag=v0.6.1
   - Copy release notes from `RELEASE_PUBLICATION_GUIDE_v0.6.1.md` Section 2.1
   - Upload `pohlang-v0.6.1-windows.zip` (already built)
   - Publish the release

3. **Re-run the failed workflow** (optional):
   - Go to: https://github.com/AlhaqGH/PohLang/actions
   - Find the failed "Simple Release" workflow
   - Click "Re-run failed jobs"
   - It will now upload artifacts to the existing release

## Current Workflow Status Check

To see the exact error:

1. Visit: https://github.com/AlhaqGH/PohLang/actions
2. Click on the failed "Simple Release" workflow
3. Look at the error message in the "Upload to Release" step

Common error messages and solutions:

### Error: "Release not found"
**Solution:** Create the release manually first (Option B, step 2)

### Error: "Resource not accessible by integration"
**Solution:** Check repository settings ‚Üí Actions ‚Üí General ‚Üí Workflow permissions ‚Üí Enable "Read and write permissions"

### Error: "Tag v0.6.1 not found"
**Solution:** Verify tag exists with `git tag -l v0.6.1`

## Recommended Action Plan

**I recommend Option B (Manual Release)** because:

‚úÖ More control over release notes and presentation  
‚úÖ Can include all artifacts (runtime + VSIXs + SDK)  
‚úÖ Can preview before publishing  
‚úÖ Workflow can still add platform binaries afterward if needed

**Steps:**

1. ‚úÖ Keep the failed workflow as-is (no action needed)
2. ‚úÖ Create the GitHub release manually with full release notes
3. ‚úÖ Upload `pohlang-v0.6.1-windows.zip` 
4. ‚è∏Ô∏è Optionally re-run workflow to add Linux/macOS binaries

## Next Steps

Proceed with creating the GitHub releases as planned:

1. **PohLang Runtime v0.6.1**: https://github.com/AlhaqGH/PohLang/releases/new?tag=v0.6.1
2. **Language Extension v0.3.3**: https://github.com/AlhaqGH/PohLang-Hub/releases/new?tag=v0.3.3
3. **PLHub Extension v0.2.4**: https://github.com/AlhaqGH/PLHub/releases/new?tag=ext-v0.2.4
4. **PLHub SDK v0.5.5**: https://github.com/AlhaqGH/PLHub/releases/new?tag=sdk-v0.5.5

All release notes are ready in `RELEASE_PUBLICATION_GUIDE_v0.6.1.md`!

**Status:** The failed workflow is expected and not a blocker. Proceed with manual release creation! üöÄ
